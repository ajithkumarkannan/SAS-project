**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SAS**
📌 Project Overview

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SAS on two datasets: Initial_Study and Second_Study. The goal is to merge, clean, and analyze the datasets to uncover patterns, relationships, and key insights in healthcare data.

🔍 Key Objectives

* Load and preprocess the Initial_Study and Second_Study datasets.

* Merge datasets for a comprehensive analysis.

* Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, formatting variables).

* Generate descriptive statistics using PROC MEANS, PROC FREQ, and PROC UNIVARIATE.

* Conduct correlation analysis using PROC CORR.

* Perform statistical tests (e.g., Two-Way ANOVA) to examine group differences.

* Visualize key findings using PROC SGPLOT.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques

* SAS Procedures:

  * PROC IMPORT – Load the datasets.

  * DATA STEP – Clean and prepare data.

  * PROC SORT & PROC SQL – Merge Initial_Study and Second_Study.

  * PROC MEANS & PROC FREQ – Summarize data.

  * PROC CORR – Compute correlations.

  * PROC GLM – Run Two-Way ANOVA for statistical analysis.

  * PROC SGPLOT – Visualize data distributions and relationships.

📊 Key Insights

* Identified differences between Initial_Study and Second_Study populations.

* Evaluated correlations between key healthcare variables.

* Used Two-Way ANOVA to determine if site and another factor significantly affected an outcome.

Discovered trends in patient outcomes across sites.
